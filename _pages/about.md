My name is Odysseas Bouziotis and I am a postgraduate student at the University of Manchester.

I am studying MSc Robotics and expected to finish in September 2024.

I am particularly interested in programming languages such as Python, C, and Matlab while I am also fascinated in Machine Learning, Object Detection Techniques, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

More about me
======

In July 2023 I graduated with honours from the University of Birmingham 🎓🎓🎓

My undergraduate degree was on Mechanical Enginnering ⚙️⚙️⚙️

I achieved a first with an overall GPA of 3.75 or 70% and particularly exceeded in the Engineering Mathematics, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Design, Integrated Design Projects, and Computational Fluid Dynamics modules as well as my thesis. 📚📚📚

My thesis was on Robotics for Medical Device Inspection, where I deployed an object detection model to successfully detect the different components of a stairlift device. For the deployment of my model I acquired a data set and trained it using Roboflow while also I implemented the YOLOv5 algorithm. 🤖🤖🤖

I also undertook in field working experience on a 20MW solar farm as part of my summer internship. ⚡🔋🌞  

I am also passionate about sports. I have played basketball for more than 7 years where I participated in the Birmingham's University Team managing to win the league.🏀🏀🏀
