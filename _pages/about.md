My name is Odysseas Bouziotis and I just completed my postgraduate studies at the University of Manchester.

I studied MSc Robotics and expected to graduate in December 2024 (Course completion in 2nd of September 2024).

I am a proactive engineer that constantly seeks new challenges to grow both as a person and as a professional. 
I have a strong desire to enhance my knowledge in Autonomous Systems, Control Systems, Embedded Systems, SLAM systems, and Autonomous Navigation.


More About Me
======

In July 2023 I graduated with honours from the University of Birmingham.

I Completed the Mechanical Engineering (BEng) degree programme.

Achieved a first class grade with an overall GPA of 3.75 or 70%.
Particularly exceeded in modules such as:
Fluid Mechanics and Energy Transfer, CFD and FEA,
Mechatronics and Control Engineering, Powertrain
and Vehicle Engineering, and Sustainable Energy and the Environment.

The title of my BEng dissertation was "Robotics for Medical Device Inspection". As part of my project, I had to deploy an object detection model to detect different components in a stairlift device (medical component). To develop a robust model, I created a custom dataset and by utilising Roboflow I applied augmentation techniques to the images such as changing the brightness level, adding noise, scaling, and blurring. The performed predictions were made from the implemented YOLOv5 algorithm and its sub-architectures.

In the summer of 2023 I joined the [Switch On Ltd](https://www.switchonpower.co.uk/) company to gain experience under a 6-week internship program. 
I was part of a 12-member group, dedicated to cover all the electrical connections needed in a 20MW solar farm.

I am also very passionate about sports. From a very young age, I started playing football in local academies for more than 5 years. At my teenage years, I transitioned to basketball and continued to play at the University of Birmingham. In my first year, I was captain of the Development Team, while a year later I progressed to the 2nd Team where we managed to qualify in the next division of the BUCS league.
